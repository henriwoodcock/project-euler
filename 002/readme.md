# 002 Even Fibonacci numbers

## Problem
> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution
Loop indefinitely until the sum of the last two items > 4 million. Brute force should still be good enough for this simple problem.

To loop indefinitely until some condition use:
```python
while(True):
  if some_condition:
    break
```
To sum the even numbers the solution is similar to the previous one and modulus could be found.

Another method could be to notice that odd+odd=even and even+odd=odd. This gives the sequence to be: odd, even, odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even, ...
