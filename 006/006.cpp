/*
006 Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
