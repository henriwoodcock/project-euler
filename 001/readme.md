# 001 Multiples of 3 and 5

## Problem
> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Solution
 Loop through all natural numbers below 1000, check if it a multiple of 3 or 5 and finally add to a sum tally.

To find a multiple of 3 or 5 the modulus can be found.

_The natural numbers are the set 1,2,3,4..._

Modulus operation in python:
```python
x = 50
x%5 = 0
```
